Currently in development. Should convert most things.

Numbers not included.

`import { toFuthark, toLatin } from 'texttofuthark';`
`let rune = toFuthark('a');`
`console.log(rune);`

should output áš¨

Future updates:
Right now, the array with the letters and runes includes the html entities and name of the rune. They aren't usable yet, but it will be coming.
